bcc0b3df-d37f-4f32-a841-1d219301f75e,Verena Wettstein,I absolutely love this app. The sleep stories and meditations help me let go of my busy day and get to sleep much more easily. The reflections are amazing for my mental well-being. Definitely worth the subscription.,5,0,6.68.1,2025-04-26 17:11:43
804ca397-e04a-4214-be56-20e4683ca3a8,Marina Michaels,"Perfect sleep solution. I went from being able to fall aslerp instantly to lying awake for a long time. I wouldn't have thought sleep stories would help me sleep, but they do. My favorite stories are about Humphrey, a tuxedo cat. The Calm app has plenty of sleep stories, as well as music, meditations, and many related resources for relaxing and falling asleep. I've made some sleep story playlists that I listen to each night.The app is a bit buggy; sometimes it stops playing a sleep story.",5,6,6.68.1,2025-04-26 13:24:27

4444ae7d-91bb-48f1-ae7e-65a0753d1a3b,Raerae,"This app is phenomenal. I use it every single night to sleep. I have been using it for years to listen to the thunderstorm. I don't use any paid features. Just last night, for the first time ever, there was a video advertisement with someone talking. I didn't click on anything to activate the ad. I had simply unlocked my phone, and the app was up because I was going to sleep. This is unacceptable, in my opinion. This app is used at full volume for me, and my husband was already asleep.",5,9,6.68.1,2025-04-25 10:49:03

Every time I open the app, I get 3 different popups before I can get back to the main page. I don't need the app asking me how I slept, how I liked the story, and suggesting random things. the kids content is also hard to find. If it weren't for the good stories the app would have made me quit long ago.",2,1,6.68.1,2025-04-24 22:49:21

I do hear the male voices better than female ones. Perhaps this is just because I am older so that sounds take over voices. I use this until my frustration causes me to stop altogether. Maybe I just need to cancel subscription and find something else. I go to sleep every night with the distant ocean sounds because those are not overpowering to me.,1,45,6.65,2025-03-23 11:56:11

Most are just annoying and trivial. Balance creates a system of meditation podcasts focused on different steps, while this is just a random listening about meditation. Also there is no auto play but annoying screens with no ""next"" button.",3,0,6.64,2025-03-13 14:00:25

It's usually 10min meditation videos. 5 min of it is a yapping session about stuff i don't care about and when you finally start the mediation you end it in few minutes because they talk so much.
